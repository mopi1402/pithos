Never create barrel files (index.ts) that export multiple modules.

Never generate code in French. Always use English for code, comments, and documentation.

Never add explanatory comments in code (except for documentation purposes).

Always add JSDoc comments to generate proper documentation.

Keep code as simple and clean as possible.

Always use existing helpers/utils/types before creating new code.

Maximize tree-shaking by preferring pure functions over classes when appropriate.

.d.ts files are automatically generated.

Project uses TypeScript 5, ESNext modules, and ES2020 target.

Always type variables and place types in types/subfolder directory.

For each new function, always check what already exists to avoid reinventing the wheel.

Always ask user for approval before making changes as breaking changes must be managed (npm package).
